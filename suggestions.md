# Suggestions for FHA Data Manager improvements

## Code Quality & Maintainability
- [x] Add comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase, particularly in `download.py`, `import_data.py`, and `mtgdicts.py`, to improve IDE support and catch type-related bugs early.
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns across modules with custom exception classes (e.g., `FHADataError`, `ValidationError`, `DownloadError`) for more informative error messages.
- [ ] Add more docstring examples to complex functions, especially in `import_data.py` and `download.py`, showing typical usage patterns with small code snippets.
- [x] Add logging levels consistently across all modules (currently some modules use logging better than others) to aid in debugging data processing issues.

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Expand test coverage to include `download.py`, `download_cli.py`, `import_data.py`, and `import_cli.py` - currently these core modules lack unit tests.
- [ ] Add integration tests that run the full download → import → validate → analyze pipeline on a small sample dataset to catch end-to-end issues.
- [ ] Add property-based tests (using `hypothesis`) for data cleaning functions to test edge cases automatically.

## Documentation
- [ ] Complete the API reference documentation in `docs/api/README.md` with detailed function signatures, parameters, and return types for all public functions.
- [ ] Add a troubleshooting guide in `docs/` covering common issues (missing data, FIPS mapping failures, download errors, memory issues with large datasets).
- [ ] Create a "Getting Started" tutorial that walks through a complete research workflow from download to publication-ready analysis.
- [ ] Document the data quality issues mentioned in README.md (e.g., August 2014 refinance data) in a dedicated data quality log with suggested workarounds.
- [ ] Add docstring examples to all analysis modules showing typical usage patterns with expected output formats.

## Developer Experience
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks with `ruff` for linting and `black` for formatting to maintain consistent code style.
- [ ] Add a `pyproject.toml` configuration for test coverage reporting with minimum coverage thresholds.
- [ ] Create a `Makefile` or `justfile` with common development tasks (test, lint, format, build-docs, clean).
- [ ] Create a development setup script that installs dependencies, sets up pre-commit hooks, and verifies the environment.

## Performance & Scalability
- [x] Implement parallel processing for batch operations (e.g., processing multiple months concurrently during import) using `concurrent.futures` or `multiprocessing`.
- [ ] Add support for incremental updates to the hive-structured database so users can append new months without reprocessing the entire dataset.
- [ ] Optimize FIPS code matching in `add_county_fips()` by pre-building lookup tables instead of repeated string operations.
- [ ] Consider using Polars lazy evaluation more extensively in analysis functions to defer computation until necessary.

## Data Quality & Validation
- [ ] Create a data quality dashboard that visualizes validation results over time to track data quality trends across monthly releases.
- [ ] Add automated anomaly detection for monthly data releases (e.g., sudden drops in loan counts, unusual geographic distributions, interest rate outliers).
- [ ] Implement schema versioning to track changes in FHA data column names and types over time, with automatic migration utilities.
- [ ] Add validation rules specific to temporal consistency (e.g., checking for implausible month-over-month changes in institution activity).

## User Interface & Accessibility
- [ ] Create Jupyter notebook templates for common research tasks (lender analysis, geographic analysis, validation reports) in an `notebooks/` directory.
- [ ] Build a simple web dashboard using `streamlit` or `panel` for interactive data exploration without coding.
- [ ] Build a CLI tool for quick data queries (e.g., `fha-data query --lender "Wells Fargo" --year 2020 --output results.csv`).

## Data Management
- [ ] Implement a data versioning system to track which monthly files have been downloaded and processed, with checksum validation.
- [ ] Build a data catalog that documents all available variables, their data types, coverage periods, and any known quality issues.

## Package Distribution
- [ ] Publish the package to PyPI to enable `pip install fha-data-manager` for easier distribution.
- [ ] Create a Docker image with pre-configured environment and dependencies for reproducible research environments.
- [ ] Build platform-specific wheels for faster installation on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- [ ] Create a "batteries-included" distribution that includes sample data for immediate experimentation.

## Research Dissemination
- [ ] Build a gallery of research outputs (charts, tables, maps) that can be generated using the package.
- [ ] Create citation guidelines and a CITATION.cff file for researchers who use this package in publications.
- [ ] Build an FAQ addressing common research questions about FHA data interpretation and limitations.

## New Analysis Capabilities
- [x] Implement market concentration metrics (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) at national, state, and county levels to study lender competition over time.
- [ ] Create cohort analysis tools to track lender entry/exit patterns and survival rates over time.

## Research Features
- [x] Build a lender-level panel dataset within `fha_data_manager/analysis/` that extends `fha_data_manager.analysis.exploratory.analyze_lender_activity` by aggregating loan counts, total volume, average interest rates, and purchase-versus-refinance shares at annual or quarterly frequency, and export the result for econometric modeling (e.g., market share and Herfindahl analyses).
- [x] Leverage the `import_fha_data.add_county_fips` enrichment and add geographic summary helpers under `fha_data_manager/analysis/geo.py` to create county- and metro-level tables (loan counts, median mortgage amounts, interest rate dispersion) that researchers can merge with BLS/ACS indicators when studying local housing market dynamics.
- [x] Combine insights from the sponsor/originator snapshots with `fha_data_manager.analysis.network` utilities to build network analytics (e.g., bipartite graphs, centrality metrics) that illuminate how sponsor relationships influence FHA loan flows.
- [x] Expand `InstitutionAnalyzer.analyze_name_changes_over_time` in `fha_data_manager/analysis/institutions.py` to emit a structured event log of lender/sponsor renamings and ownership transitions so researchers can run event studies on rebranding or consolidation episodes.
- [x] Enhance `create_lender_id_to_name_crosswalk` in `import_fha_data.py` by capturing the first/last observed periods for each ID–name pairing and flagging conflicting names, enabling clean joins to regulatory and financial datasets.
