# Suggestions for FHA Data Research

- [x] Build a lender-level panel dataset within `fha_data_manager/analysis/` that extends `fha_data_manager.analysis.exploratory.analyze_lender_activity` by aggregating loan counts, total volume, average interest rates, and purchase-versus-refinance shares at annual or quarterly frequency, and export the result for econometric modeling (e.g., market share and Herfindahl analyses).
- [x] Leverage the `import_fha_data.add_county_fips` enrichment and add geographic summary helpers under `fha_data_manager/analysis/geo.py` to create county- and metro-level tables (loan counts, median mortgage amounts, interest rate dispersion) that researchers can merge with BLS/ACS indicators when studying local housing market dynamics.
- [ ] Expand `InstitutionAnalyzer.analyze_name_changes_over_time` in `fha_data_manager/analysis/institutions.py` to emit a structured event log of lender/sponsor renamings and ownership transitions so researchers can run event studies on rebranding or consolidation episodes.
- [ ] Enhance `create_lender_id_to_name_crosswalk` in `import_fha_data.py` by capturing the first/last observed periods for each IDâ€“name pairing and flagging conflicting names, enabling clean joins to regulatory and financial datasets.
- [x] Combine insights from the sponsor/originator snapshots with `fha_data_manager.analysis.network` utilities to build network analytics (e.g., bipartite graphs, centrality metrics) that illuminate how sponsor relationships influence FHA loan flows.
